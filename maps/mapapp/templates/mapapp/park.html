   Perambur Flyover Park (Tamil: பெரம்பூர் மேம்பாலப் பூங்கா), officially known as Murasoli Maran Flyover Park (Tamil: முரசொலி மாறன் மேம்பாலப் பூங்கா), is an urban park in the neighbourhood of Perambur, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The Chennai Corporation has started earmarking area in parks and public spaces for development of the next phase of Metro stations in various parts of the city. Greenery in the Murasoli Maran Park in Perambur, is expected to be reduced because of the second phase.[1] Families are increasingly flocking to facilities such as the Murasoli Maran Park near Perambur flyover.[2] For over years, the sprawling Murasoli Maran Park at Perambur was a centre of attraction, esoecially for the kids. The lockdown and poor maintenance have however adversely affected the footfall in the park. This is one of the biggest parks in the locality. But the local body is not taking interest in maintaining it.[3]
